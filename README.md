Example blue-green application can be found at the following link. Absolutely fork it for your own use and point Jenkins at your fork so when updates occur, they occur off your work. This is a gradle-based app to be imported into STS. Install the Pivotal Cloud Foundry plug-in for Eclipse to push the application during testing.
